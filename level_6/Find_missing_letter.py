# Write a method that takes an array of consecutive (increasing) letters as input and that returns the missing letter
# in the array. You will always get an valid array. And it will be always exactly one letter be missing. The length of
# the array will always be at least 2.
# The array will always contain letters in only one case.
# Example:
# ['a','b','c','d','f'] -> 'e'
# ['O','Q','R','S'] -> 'P'
# (Use the English alphabet with 26 letters!)
