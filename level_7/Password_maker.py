# One suggestion to build a satisfactory password is to start with a memorable phrase or sentence and make a password
# by extracting the first letter of each word.
#
# Even better is to replace some of those letters with numbers (e.g., the letter O can be replaced with the number 0):
#
# instead of including i or I put the number 1 in the password;
# instead of including o or O put the number 0 in the password;
# instead of including s or S put the number 5 in the password.
# Examples:
# "Give me liberty or give me death"  --> "Gml0gmd"
# "Keep Calm and Carry On"            --> "KCaC0"
